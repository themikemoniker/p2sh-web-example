### Set up your Replit Regtest environment.
# See replitsetup.txt for step by step instructions on how to start bitcoind in regtest here and get some coins to play with.

# If you're here, you should have a spendable coin in your regtest wallet.

# Click into the "Shell" to run all the bitcoin-cli commands

# We'll use the following alias for 'bitcoin-cli -regtest', run this command in your shell to use the same alias if you want
#
# alias bcr="bitcoin-cli -regtest"
#
# The following command should return some json with at least 1 spendable coin:
#
# bcr listunspent
#
# If you got json back with at least one 50BTC coin, you're ready to go. If not, go through replitsetup.py to get ready.

### Writing our P2SH Locking and Unlocking Scripts

# We're going to write a custom locking script.
# We want to lock our bitcoin to the sha256 of some input preimage, such that only the person who knows the preimage can unlock it.
# Our preimage will be the bytes encoding of the string: 'Zero conf channels were a mistake'
# (Python has nice syntactic sugar that converts a string to bytes by putting a b in front of it, see below)
# '5a65726f20636f6e66206368616e6e656c7320776572652061206d697374616b65'
preimage = b'Zero conf channels were a mistake'
preimage_hex = preimage.hex()

# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('preimage_hex: ', preimage_hex, '\n')

# The "lock" will be the sha256 digest of the above preimage. We've provided this lock in hexadecimal below.
# '8539f59ef34c750ab9d9f2a1071f2cd7542e318955be8e9e9eab5ab32037b2de'
lock = hashlib.sha256(preimage).digest()
lock_hex = lock.hex()
# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('lock_hex: ', lock_hex, '\n')

# TODO: Convert the Lock into the following bitcoin script, then encode it as hex: OP_SHA256 <lock_hex> OP_EQUAL
redeem_script_hex = 'a8208539f59ef34c750ab9d9f2a1071f2cd7542e318955be8e9e9eab5ab32037b2de87'
# Tip: op_codes are a single byte, you can look them up on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script
# Tip: data is the hex encoding, prefaced by the length. A sha256 digest is always 32 bytes, which is '20' as hex
# For a P2SH, this locking script will also be called our 'redeem script' which will be the last argument in our scriptSig unlocking the TX.

# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('redeem_script_hex: ', redeem_script_hex, '\n')

# If you did it correctly, you should be able to run the following bitcoin-cli command:
#
# bcr decodescript my-locking-script-in-hex
#
# and part of its output should look like the skeleton below:
# TODO: Fill in the rest of the decodescript details returned by the bitcoin-cli. Your 'asm' should look the same as below, if not you didn't write the locking script correctly so check your work there
decodescript = {
    "asm":
    "OP_SHA256 8539f59ef34c750ab9d9f2a1071f2cd7542e318955be8e9e9eab5ab32037b2de OP_EQUAL",
    "type": "",
    "p2sh": "",
    "segwit": {
        "asm": "",
        "hex": "",
        "address": "",
        "type": "",
        "p2sh-segwit": ""
    },
}

## Locking our Bitcoin to the P2SH

# Alrighty! We've got everything we need to do the funding transaction locking bitcoin to our Pay to Script Hash
# Bitcoin did all the conversions for us!
# The "p2sh" value is the encoding of the scripthash where the redeem script is our custom script
# We're going to do a transaction locking 10.0000025BTC to that "p2sh" address
# Run the following command:
#
# bcr sendtoaddress 'the-psh-address-it-starts-with-2' 10.0000025
#
# The returned hash is the txid, in big endian, of that transaction, copy it below:
funding_txid_big_endian = '311d0df1af67b2438a7a030f1a11b76708e96fa6393adfddc19f2579034cd03b'

# Remember, we're in regtest no we control block production! Let's mine a block to confirm the funding tx
#
# bcr generatetoaddress 1 $(bcr getnewaddress)
#

## Preparing the input to unlock our Bitcoin

# If you'll recall, the input skeleton for a legacy transaction looks like this:
input_skeleton = {'txid': '', 'vout': '', 'scriptSig': '', 'sequence': ''}
# we've already got the txid from before, but it's in big endian!
# Bitcoin wants the input txid in little endian, so let's flip it here:
funding_txid_little_endian = bytes.fromhex(funding_txid_big_endian)[::-1].hex()

# Now we need to fill in the vout. It'll either be 0 or 1, you can check in the funding tx with the command:
#
# bcr gettransaction funding_txid_big_endian
#
# In the returned json under the "details" key, you'll see the payment and whether the vout was 0 or 1
# input whether it was 0 or 1 here, and convert it to 4 byte little endian while you're at it eg '01000000':
vout = '0'

# We're not using sequence for anything fancy here, so let's just set it to 'ffffffff', the max val
sequence = 'ffffffff'

## Assembling the ScriptSig

# To Unlock this P2SH we have to provide 2 elements: the preimage, and the redeem script
# we've got both of these above, we just need te turn them into script data fields by adding lengths
# Reminder, the length is in hex, so 2 characters, and it's the number of bytes that make up the data field
preimage_len = (len(preimage)).to_bytes(1, 'little').hex()

# TODO: set the len, in hex for the redeem script like we did above for the preimage
# we declared the redeem script as the variable redeem_script_hex
redeem_script_hex_len = (len(redeem_script_hex) // 2).to_bytes(1, 'little').hex()

# Finally we need to combine the 2 datafields into a single scriptSig and add a scriptSigLen
scriptSig = preimage_len + preimage_hex + \
    redeem_script_hex_len + redeem_script_hex
scriptSig_len = (len(scriptSig) // 2).to_bytes(1, 'little').hex()

scriptSig_hex = scriptSig_len + scriptSig

# We've now got our input ready!
# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('scriptSig_hex: ', scriptSig_hex, '\n')
print('scriptSig', scriptSig, '\n')

# Exercise: Fill in the following input skeleton as hex with your calculated values:
input = {
    'txid': funding_txid_little_endian,  # 32 bytes, little endian
    'vout': '00000000',  # 4 bytes, little endian
    'scriptSig_len': scriptSig_len,  # Compact field size
    'scriptSig': scriptSig,  # big endian
    # TODO , this scriptSig might need to be turned into bytes and flipped around
    'sequence': 'ffffffff',  # 4 bytes, little endian
}
# Then let's squash it all together into a single hex string
input_hex = input['txid'] + input['vout'] + input['scriptSig_len'] + input[
    'scriptSig'] + input['sequence']

# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('input_hex: ', input_hex, '\n')

## Building our Unlocking TX

# Let's use the bitcoin-cli to create the framework for our TX.
# We'll pass in the output back to ourself, but leave the inputs empty
# Then we'll just plug our input hex string we made above into the TX

# get a new address you'll sweep the funds back to when we unlock from the P2SH:
#
# bcr getnewaddress
#
# Copy it below
sweep_address = 'bcrt1q8ns88y689yxqe3m4wlj94l20dr3he5eqpr72g0'

# Use the bitcoin-cli to create the transaction structure with the command,
#
# bcr createrawtransaction '[]' '[{"your-address-here": 10}]'
#
# We're creating a single output, and not passing in any inputs
# copy the returned raw transaction hex here:
raw_tx_hex_no_input = '02000000000100ca9a3b000000001600143ce0739347290c0cc77577e45afd4f68e37cd32000000000'

# The rawtx should start with: 020000000001.... : Version 2, 0 inputs, 1 output
# The following code will insert the input we made above, tack on your raw_tx_hex output and locktime, and put it back together as a completed transaction
version = '02000000'
input_count = '01'
raw_tx_done = version + input_count + input_hex + raw_tx_hex_no_input[10:]

# TODO: uncomment the print statement and hit the Green 'Run' button to see your work so far in the console.
print('raw_tx_done: ', raw_tx_done, '\n')

## Testing and Sending our Unlocking TX:

# Our TX is ready to broadcast! If you did everything per the instructions above, you should be able to run:
#
# bcr testmempoolaccept '["your-completed-tx-hex"]'
#
# and it should return 'complete: true' in the json

# If it returned true, it's valid and ready to send!! Let's sweep our bitcoin back, unlocking the P2SH, by running,
#
# bcr sendrawtransaction your-complete-tx-hex

### CONGRATULATIONS!! YOU'VE JUST BUILT YOUR FIRST P2SH LOCKING AND UNLOCKING TXS BY HAND!!!
